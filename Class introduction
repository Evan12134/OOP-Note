Object Oriented Programming:

1. Programming practice to design modular reusable software systems
2. OOP designs programs with creation of Objects
3. An approach that focuses on the definition of data rather than the input → processing → output logic (OOP vs procedure-oriented programming)
4. The goal is to create an object that we can define and provide functionality to solve problems

An object in OOP is an instance of a class where this object can be either a variable, a function, a data structure, or a combination of such

__init__ and self:
a method that is used as soon as an object is created, the purpose of the use of this is to create object's attributes
"self" parameter is used to denote that the method is applied and accessible for the object itself
self will also treat its own attributes as local

class: 
An abstract description of all objects that can be made from this set class 
A class contains attributes. Attributes are an object's accessable tools1. 
Fields: Variables that belong to an object or a class
Type 1: It belongs to the instance of the class
Type 2: It belongs to the class itself
2. Methods: Functions that the object or the object can callre an object can be instantiated from.

Ways to define a class: 
class Keyword: 

Example: 
class Person:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
	#end of initialization
	
def greet(self): # the self parameter is always required
		print(“Hello, my name is”, self.name)
	#end of greet
#end of class Person

p = Person(‘Evan’)
p.greet()
